# Summary of Matrix.py

## Overview
In this project, we created a Python application using Tkinter to generate a matrix based on user input and applied a simple Machine Learning algorithm to the generated matrix. The application allows the user to input a value for `n`, generates an `n x n` matrix using a specific formula, and then applies Linear Regression to the matrix.

## Key Concepts

### Tkinter
- **Tkinter** is a standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library in Python. It provides various widgets to create user interfaces.
- **Widgets used**:
  - `Tk()`: Creates the main window.
  - `Label`: Displays text.
  - `Entry`: Allows the user to input text.
  - `Button`: Triggers an action when clicked.
  - `Text`: Displays multi-line text.

### Matrix Generation
- The matrix is generated using a nested list comprehension:

```bash
matrix = [[(i + j) % n + 1 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]
``` 

- This formula creates an `n x n` matrix where each element is calculated as `(i + j) % n + 1`.

### Machine Learning
- **scikit-learn**: A popular machine learning library in Python.
- **Linear Regression**: A simple and commonly used algorithm for predictive analysis.
  - **Steps**:
    1. Convert the matrix to a numpy array.
    2. Define the target variable `y` as the sum of each row in the matrix.
    3. Fit the Linear Regression model to the data.
    4. Predict the target variable using the fitted model.
  - **Code**:
```bash
X = np.array(matrix)
y = np.sum(X, axis=1)
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)
predictions = model.predict(X)
``` 

- Enter a value for `n` in the GUI and click "Generate Matrix" to see the generated matrix and the machine learning predictions.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to integrate a GUI application with machine learning algorithms in Python. It covers the basics of Tkinter for creating user interfaces and scikit-learn for applying machine learning models.
